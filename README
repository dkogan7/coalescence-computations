The two files in this repo are used to for computational results in 'Covariance of coalescence times in a diploid Wright Fisher model with recombination and selfing'

The file matrixcomp.mlx is a MATLAB file used to compute the covariance and correlation for Theorem 1 and Corollary 1 of the paper. The Markov Transition matrix discussed in the paper can be found in here, as well as appropriate steps to obtain the exact formulas of limiting correlation and covariance.
